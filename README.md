## Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 We created this app because we all volunterred our time to Chingu. Chingu is a remote collaboration community for like-minded developers to make projects in a team setting. We submitted a project to be reviewed for the program. After Jim Medlock and his team looked over our projects it was decided that we were going to be in Voyage 47 tier 1. This tier is for beginners and you can work your way up to tier 3. Once we found out that we were wroking together Jim gave us information on our GitHub that he created for us and his expectations of the project. We spent 6 weeks collectivly working on developing our app.

## Running the project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.Install bootstrap npm install bootstrap (check in package-json in the dependencies section to see if it downloaded properly)
2.create a index.html, style.css and App.javascript(js) file
3.If you don'y have "open with live server" you can install that on the right hand side of Visual Studio Code click the "extenstions" logo
4.I suggest to type "Hello World" with basic CSS like changing the header to be blue (or a color of your choice to see if your app is working)
5. Now that you have your app up and running you can start coding!
